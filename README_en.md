# 🎯 Generating Ad Titles from arXiv Abstracts with Style Control

Fine-tuning the T5-small model to generate scientific article titles with controllable styles (`<humorous>`, `<short>`, `<standard>`).

---

## 📌 Description

This project demonstrates an approach to **controlled generation**: the user specifies a style tag, and the model generates a matching title based on an abstract. It uses Hugging Face models along with the Transformers and Datasets libraries.

## 🧠 Example

**Input:**

```
<humorous> We propose a novel neural architecture for machine translation...
```

**Output:**

```
Lost in Translation? Not with Our AI!
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Prepare the data:
```bash
python data/prepare_dataset.py
```

3. Train the model:
```bash
python models/train.py
```

4. Generate titles:
```bash
python models/generate.py
```

5. Evaluate quality and style:
```bash
python evaluation/evaluate.py
```

## 📊 Results

| Model               | BLEU | Style Accuracy |
|---------------------|------|----------------|
| T5 without control  | 0.21 | 42%            |
| T5 with control     | 0.25 | **71%**        |
| GPT-3.5 + Prompting | 0.28 | 66%            |
